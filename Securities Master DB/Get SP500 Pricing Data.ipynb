    "In order to obtain the historical data for the current S&P500 constituents, we must first query the database for the list of all the symbols. Once the list of symbols (along with the symbol IDs) have been returned, it is possible to call the Yahoo Finance API and download the historical pricing data for each symbol. Once we have each symbol we can insert the data into the database in turn. Here's the Python code to carry this out:"
