    "#### To install MySQL please choose the appropriate platform:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Windows - To read about the installation procedure for installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows, please take a look at the MySQL documentation. To find the downloadable binaries for Windows, please take a look at this page.\n",
    "    Mac OSX - You can download the binaries for Mac OSX at the MySQL downloads page. Alternatively, you can install MySQL via homebrew. This tutorial is useful for getting started.\n",
    "    Linux/UNIX - You have the choice of either downloading a binary from your distribution or compiling from source. On a Debian/Ubuntu system you can type sudo apt-get install mysql-server. If you are on a RPM-based distribution such as Fedora or Cent OS, you can type yum install mysql-server. To build MySQL from the source code (brave!) please look here.\n",
    "NOTE: When installing mysql, you will be prompted for a password. If you don't set, it will have a blank password which you'll need to set later - total pain in the ass. See https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/05/18/where-is-the-mysql-5-7-root-password/"

While you can use the root user, it is considered bad practice from a security point of view, as it grants too many permissions and can lead to a compromised system. On a local machine this is mostly irrelevant, but in a remote production environment you will certainly need to create a user with reduced permissions. In this instance our user will be called sec_user. Remember to replace password with a secure password:\n",

    "Schema Design for Equities Securities Master\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now installed MySQL and have configured a user with which to interact with our database. At this stage we are ready to construct the necessary tables to hold our financial data. For a simple, straightforward equities master we will create four tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Exchange - The exchange table lists the exchanges we wish to obtain equities pricing information from. In this instance it will almost exclusively be the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ).\n",
    "    DataVendor - This table lists information about historical pricing data vendors. We will be using Yahoo Finance to source our end-of-day (EOD) data. By introducing this table, we make it straightforward to add more vendors if necessary, such as Google Finance.\n",
    "    Symbol - The symbol table stores the list of ticker symbols and company information. Right now we will be avoiding issues such as differing share classes and multiple symbol names. We will cover such issues in later articles!\n",
    "    DailyPrice - This table stores the daily pricing information for each security. It can become very large if many securities are added. Hence it is necessary to optimise it for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "MySQL is an extremely flexible database in that it allows you to customise how the data is stored in an underlying storage engine. The two primary contenders in MySQL are MyISAM and InnoDB. Although I won't go into the details of storage engines (of which there are many!), I will say that MyISAM is more useful for fast reading (such as querying across large amounts of price information), but it doesn't support transactions (necessary to fully rollback a multi-step operation that fails mid way through). InnoDB, while transaction safe, is slower for reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "InnoDB also allows row-level locking when making writes, while MyISAM locks the entire table when writing to it. This can have performance issues when writing a lot of information to arbitrary points in the table (such as with UPDATE statements). This is a deep topic, so I will leave the discussion to another day!\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use InnoDB as it is natively transaction safe and provides row-level locking. If we find that a table is slow to be read, we can create indexes as a first step and then change the underlying storage engine if performance is still an issue. All of our tables will use the UTF-8 character set, as we wish to support international exchanges. You can read more about UTF-8 encoding at this Wikipedia page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with the schema and CREATE TABLE SQL code for the exchange table. It stores the abbreviation and name of the exchange (i.e. NYSE - New York Stock Exchange) as well as the geographic location. It also supports a currency and a timezone offset from UTC.
