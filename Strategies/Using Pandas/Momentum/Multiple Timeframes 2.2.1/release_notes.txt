2.2.1
Break out top_n tuple into qty_long_period qty_med_period qty_short_period
When running optimization function, verify that param combo has never been run before

2.2
Fixed Trailing stop to work with new resample / rebalance changes

2.1
Changed return calculations to use log returns until end of optimization and strategy run, 
at which time returns are converted to simple returns to pass to quantstats module.
Optimization:
	Implmented checks to ensure that period length parameter combinations make sense, 
	i.e. SMA_L length > SMA_S length.

2.0
Split out functions into modules. Still using gross returns for calculations.
