2.0
Split out functions into modules. Still using gross returns for calculations.

2.1
Changed return calculations to use log returns until end of optimization and strategy run, at which time returns are converted to simple returns to pass to quantstats module.
Optimization:
	Implmented checks to ensure that period length parameter combinations make sense, i.e. SMA_L length > SMA_S length.
